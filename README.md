[View this README on GitHub.](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-h1-empty-app)

[Provide feedback on this code example.](https://cypress.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1NTns53sK2yiljn?Q_EED=eyJVbmlxdWUgRG9jIElkIjoiQ0UyMzcxODkiLCJTcGVjIE51bWJlciI6IjAwMi0zNzE4OSIsIkRvYyBUaXRsZSI6IkVtcHR5IGFwcGxpY2F0aW9uIHRlbXBsYXRlIiwicmlkIjoiYW1hbCBtaXNocmEiLCJEb2MgdmVyc2lvbiI6IjEuMC4wIiwiRG9jIExhbmd1YWdlIjoiRW5nbGlzaCIsIkRvYyBEaXZpc2lvbiI6Ik1DRCIsIkRvYyBCVSI6IklDVyIsIkRvYyBGYW1pbHkiOiJXSUZJIn0=)

## Requirements

- [ModusToolbox&trade; software](https://www.infineon.com/modustoolbox) v3.0 or later (tested with v3.0) with ModusToolbox&trade; CYW955513 Early Access Pack.
- Board support package (BSP) minimum required version for : v0.5.0.
- Programming language: C
- Associated parts: CYW955513EVK-01

## Supported toolchains (make variable 'TOOLCHAIN')

- GNU Arm&reg; embedded compiler v10.3.1 (`GCC_ARM`) - Default value of `TOOLCHAIN`

## Supported kits (make variable 'TARGET')

- CYW955513EVK-01 Wi-Fi Bluetooth&reg; prototyping kit (`CYW955513EVK-01`) – Default value of `TARGET`

## Hardware setup

This example uses the kit’s default configuration. See the respective kit guide to ensure that the kit is configured correctly.

**Note:** The CYW955513EVK-01 Wi-Fi Bluetooth&reg; prototyping kit ships with KitProg3 version 2.30 installed. The ModusToolbox&trade; software requires KitProg3 with latest version 2.50. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3 2.50. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/Infineon/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error such as "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".

## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox&trade; Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and the command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; software tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The "project-creator-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br />

The following example will clone the "[Empty App](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-h1-empty-app)" application with the desired name "MyEmptyApp" configured for the *CYW955513EVK-01* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CYW955513EVK-01 --app-id mtb-example-h1-empty-app --user-app-name MyEmptyApp --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can invoke the Library Manager GUI tool from the terminal using `make modlibs` command or use the Library Manager CLI tool "library-manager-cli" to change the BSP.

The "library-manager-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--add-bsp-name` | Name of the BSP that should be added to the application | Required
`--set-active-bsp` | Name of the BSP that should be as active BSP for the application | Required
`--add-bsp-version`| Specify the version of the BSP that should be added to the application if you do not wish to use the latest from manifest | Optional
`--add-bsp-location`| Specify the location of the BSP (local/shared) if you prefer to add the BSP in a shared path | Optional

</details>

<details><summary><b>In third-party IDEs</b></summary>

Use one of the following options:

- **Use the standalone [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool:**

   1. Launch Project Creator from the Windows Start menu or from *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/project-creator.exe*.

   2. In the initial **Choose Board Support Package** screen, select the BSP, and click **Next**.

   3. In the **Select Application** screen, select the appropriate IDE from the **Target IDE** drop-down menu.

   4. Click **Create** and follow the instructions printed in the bottom pane to import or open the exported project in the respective IDE.

<br />

- **Use command-line interface (CLI):**

   1. Follow the instructions from the **In command-line interface (CLI)** section to create the application, and then import the libraries using the `make getlibs` command.

   2. Export the application to a supported IDE using the `make <ide>` command.

   3. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to create or import the application as an IDE project.

For a list of supported IDEs and more details, see the "Exporting to IDEs" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program**.
   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain and target are specified in the application's Makefile but you can override those values manually:
      ```
      make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TARGET=CYW955513EVK-01 TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>
3. Since this is an empty app, the main objective is to add minimal source code which can be used as the base for other appplications. This app has no observable output.
